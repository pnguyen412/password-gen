# password-gen

## Description
- The main objective of this challenge was to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria whether using alphanumeric or special characters, or both.
- In addition to the above, we were tasked with ensuring that when the "generate" button is pressed, a unique is generated to the user's specifications.
- I also used the eventlistener method to allow the button to create prompts so the user can begin creating their password.
- I learned how to manipulate functions and using if/else if statements to generate the appropriate responses from the application.
